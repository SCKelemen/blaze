# blaze ðŸ”¥
A blazing fast, actor-based, modern programming language

## abstract

Blaze is a high-level programming language similar to C# and Go#. Blaze offers Actor-style concurrency, and is designed with cloud scale data analytics in mind. 

## motivation

Developers should feel familiar with the language and code from baremetal to cloud.

## Syntax

Blaze is part of a complete language systems that also include [Ember](https://github.com/sckelemen/ember) and [Ash](https://github.com/sckelemen/ash). These three language share the same core syntax, but each are extended to support their target niche.

### Comments
```Go
// line comment

/* 
   block / multiline comment 
*/

/* inline comment */
```

### Packages
```Go
package SomePackage        // the name of the package

import "AnotherPackage"    // a single-package import 

import (                   // a multipackage import
   "ThirdPackage",
   "FourthPackage",
   "FifthPackage" 
)
```

### Varaible Declarations
```coffee
let name = expression
let count = 5

const identifier = expression
const five = 5 // immutable

const five = 6 // five == 5

int five = 5 // explicitly typed
```

### Arithmetic Operators
```coffee
let addition       = a + b
let subtraction    = a - b
let division       = a / b
let multiplication = a * b
let modulo         = a % b

let exponent       = a ** b
let negation       = -a 
let identity       = +a
```

### Logical
```coffee
let and = expressionA && expressionB
let or  = expressionA || expressionB
let not = !expression
```

### Bitwise Operators
```coffee
let and = a & b
let or  = a | b
let xor = a ^ b
let not = ~a     // bitwise complement

let lshift = a << b
let rshift = a >> b
```

### Comparison
```swift
let equality = a == b
let notequal = a != b
```

```pony 
actor Main {
  
}

```



## Actors

### Lifecycle
- PreStart()
- PreRestart()
- PostRestart()
- PostStop()

### Syntax 
```Go
// line comment

/* 
   block / multiline comment 
*/

/* inline comment */
```

```pony 
actor Main {
  
}

```
